# üé¨ Intelligent Sentiment Analysis System for Movie Reviews
## üéØ Project Purpose
- Intelligent sentiment analysis system that can classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.
- Leverage **NLP** and **Machine Learning** to develop a model that can automatically determine audience sentiment based on movie reviews.
<br>

## üìä Dataset Description
We used a **Kaggle dataset** and **TMDb API** for analysis:

- [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) ‚Äì Contains 50,000 labeled IMDb movie reviews from Kaggle used for model training and evaluation.

- [TMDb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) ‚Äì Used to fetch real-time movie reviews via HTTP GET requests for sentiment analysis within the user interface.

üìñ Data Dictionary (`IMDB Dataset 2.csv`)
 | Column Name      | Description                                      |
 |------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
 | `review`         | Full text of the movie review                    |
 | `sentiment`      | Sentiment label: positive or negative            |

## üí° Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**
- Standardized and cleaned text data for consistency.
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure data quality.
- Prepared sentiment labels and text for machine learning analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Selection**
- Used **TF-IDF** and **Word Embeddings** to convert review text into machine-readable vectors.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training**
- Built three models using TF-IDF features:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Random Forest
- Identified **Logistic Regression** as the top performer, then re-trained it using Word Embeddings for comparison.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**
- Assessed model performance using **confusion matrix** and **ROC curve**.
- Used an **open-source LLM** to cross-validate predictions from both feature extraction methods.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Web Scraping**
- Integrated with TMDb API to fetch real-time movie reviews by movie title.
- Parsed paginated responses, handled errors, and structured reviews into a DataFrame for use in the interface.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **User Interface Deployment**
- Developed an interactive UI using **Streamlit** for real-time sentiment analysis.
- Connected to the TMDb API to fetch reviews based on user-input movie titles.
- Loaded a pre-trained **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** model to classify review sentiment.
- Displayed results as positive vs. negative percentages with a simple bar chart.

<br>

## üîç Key Findings
- **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (88.78%)**, followed by SVM (88.28%) and Random Forest (83.49%).

- **TF-IDF + LR** showed balanced predictions with **a high AUC of 0.96**, while Word Embeddings + LR had more misclassifications and a lower AUC of 0.83.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Demo
 Try the app: [üé¨ IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](https://imdb-sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews.streamlit.app/)
<div align="center">
   <img src="Data%20Visualization/8%20-%20Streamlit%201.jpg" width="60%" /> 
   <img src="Data%20Visualization/8%20-%20Streamlit%202.jpg" width="60%" />
</div>

 How It Works:
1. **User Input**: Users enter a movie name in the input field, and the system automatically retrieves relevant reviews using the TMDb API.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The retrieved reviews are processed using a TF-IDF vectorizer(`tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) and Logistic Regression model(`log_reg_model.pkl`) to classify them as positive or negative.
3. **Results Display**: The system presents the number of positive and negative reviews, along with a bar chart visualization of the sentiment distribution.

<br>

## üìå Conclusion
The project built a high-performing sentiment classifier using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression. With real-time TMDb integration and a user-friendly Streamlit UI, this tool automates review analysis, offering practical value to media, film, and marketing professionals.
